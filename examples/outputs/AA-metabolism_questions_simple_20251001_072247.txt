   A) It can use either NAD+ or NADP+ as a coenzyme.
   B) It catalyses an essentially reversible reaction.
   C) When catalysing the conversion of glutamate to its carbon skeleton, the reaction involves deamination.
   D) It is not subject to allosteric regulation.
   E) It is located in the mitochondria.

4. How is glutamate useful in amino acid synthesis reactions?
   A) It activates glutaminase to release free glutamine.
   B) It can be reduced and cyclised to form glycine.
   C) It acts as an amino group donor for synthesis of nonessential amino acids.
   D) It is the main precursor of tyrosine synthesis.
   E) It is the main methyl group donor for essential amino acids.

5. Which of the following statements is correct?
   A) In humans, nonessential amino acids are exclusively synthesised from essential amino acids.
   B) Humans can attain nonessential amino acids from a protein-rich diet.
   C) Alanine is a common methyl group donor in human essential amino acid synthesis.
   D) In humans, aspartate is formed from pyruvate and is therefore a nonessential amino acid.
   E) All nonessential amino acids are catabolised to form acetoacetate.

6. Which of the following statements regarding tyrosine in humans is correct?
   A) Tyrosine is an essential amino acid as it cannot be synthesised.
   B) Catecholamines are formed following deamination of tyrosine.
   C) Tyrosine is the main precursor of carnitine in the liver.
   D) Tyrosine is commonly converted directly to serotonin or melatonin.
   E) Tyrosine is an important precursor of thyroxine in the thyroid gland.

7. Which of the following is an important role of ornithine in humans?
   A) It is one of the 20 common amino acids in all of our proteins.
   B) It is a key intermediate in the TCA cycle, combining with acetyl CoA to form citrate.
   C) It is an intermediate in the urea cycle in the kidney.
   D) It is one of two ways that NH3 groups can travel safely in blood.
   E) It is required for the cyclisation of proline.

8. Which of the following statements regarding the urea cycle in humans is INCORRECT?
   A) It aids in the excretion of nitrogen from the body.
   B) It is linked to the TCA cycle through fumarate.
   C) It occurs mainly in the liver and kidney.
   D) It is reduced when the activity of carbamoyl phosphate synthase I is activated.
   E) All reactions occur in the cytosol.

9. Which of the following best describes the energy needs of the urea cycle?
   A) 6 ATP equivalents: 4 as ATP → ADP and 2 as GTP → GDP.
   B) 4 ATP equivalents: 2 as ATP → ADP and 1 as ATP → AMP.
   C) 2 ATP equivalents: 2 as ATP → ADP, plus 2 NADH → NAD+.
   D) 3 ATP equivalents: 2 as ATP → ADP and 1 as ATP → AMP.
   E) The urea cycle does not require energy input as it is a catabolic cycle breaking down ammonia.

   A) produce ATP.
   B) synthesise amino acids.
   C) detoxify ammonia.
   D) generate NADH.

   B) Synthesis of glutamine from glutamate
   C) Oxidation of amino acids for energy
   D) Formation of urea from ammonia
   E) Conversion of ammonia to urea
