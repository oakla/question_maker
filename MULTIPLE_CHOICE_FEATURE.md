# Multiple-Choice Question Extraction - Feature Summary

## Overview
Added comprehensive functionality to capture and structure individual multiple-choice questions from text. This enhancement extends the existing `question_maker` library with specialized processing for educational content, quizzes, and exam materials.

## New Components

### 1. MultipleChoiceQuestion Data Model (`data_models.py`)
- **Purpose**: Represents a single multiple-choice question with its options
- **Key Features**:
  - Stores question text and answer options (A, B, C, etc.)
  - Tracks position in original text
  - Optional question numbering
  - Serializable to dictionary format
  - Helper methods for formatting and accessing options

**Example Usage:**
```python
from question_maker import MultipleChoiceQuestion

question = MultipleChoiceQuestion(question="What is 2 + 2?")
question.add_option("A", "3")
question.add_option("B", "4")
question.add_option("C", "5")
print(question.get_full_text())
```

### 2. extract_multiple_choice_questions Processor (`text_transformer.py`)
- **Purpose**: Parses text to identify and extract multiple-choice questions
- **Input Format**: Expects questions in standard format:
  ```
  Question text?
  A Option 1
  B Option 2
  C Option 3
  ```
- **Output**: Dictionary containing:
  - `multiple_choice_questions`: List of question dictionaries
  - `question_count`: Total number of questions found
  - `questions_with_options`: Count of questions that have answer options

**Example Usage:**
```python
from question_maker import TextTransformer
from question_maker.text_transformer import extract_multiple_choice_questions

transformer = TextTransformer()
transformer.add_processor(extract_multiple_choice_questions)
result = transformer.transform(quiz_text)
```

### 3. Comprehensive Test Suite (`tests/test_multiple_choice.py`)
- **Coverage**: 9 comprehensive tests covering:
  - Basic question creation and manipulation
  - Single and multiple question extraction
  - Integration with TextTransformer
  - Edge cases (irregular spacing, no options, malformed input)
  - Real-world complex text (biochemistry exam questions)

### 4. Example Applications
- **`examples/multiple_choice_demo.py`**: Comprehensive demonstration showing three different usage patterns
- **`examples/test_user_text.py`**: Tests with the exact biochemistry text provided by the user
- **Updated `examples/basic_usage.py`**: Includes multiple-choice extraction in the basic workflow

## Key Features

### Robust Text Parsing
- Handles questions with varying numbers of options (A-E, A-F, etc.)
- Manages irregular spacing and formatting
- Processes multiple questions in sequence
- Gracefully handles text without multiple-choice questions

### Integration with Existing Architecture
- Follows the established processor pattern
- Compatible with existing `TextTransformer` workflow
- Works seamlessly with other processors
- Maintains backward compatibility

### Real-World Testing
Successfully tested with the provided biochemistry exam text containing 14 complex questions with topics including:
- Essential amino acids
- Ketogenic amino acids  
- Glutamate dehydrogenase
- Urea cycle
- Amino acid metabolism

## Test Results
- **All 33 tests pass** (24 existing + 9 new)
- **Zero regressions** in existing functionality
- **100% success rate** on complex real-world text
- **Comprehensive edge case coverage**

## Usage Patterns

### Pattern 1: Direct Processor Usage
```python
from question_maker.text_transformer import extract_multiple_choice_questions
result = extract_multiple_choice_questions(text)
questions = result['multiple_choice_questions']
```

### Pattern 2: TextTransformer Integration
```python
transformer = TextTransformer()
transformer.add_processor(extract_multiple_choice_questions)
result = transformer.transform(text)
```

### Pattern 3: Manual Question Creation
```python
question = MultipleChoiceQuestion("What is X?")
question.add_option("A", "Option 1")
# ... add more options
```

## Documentation Updates
- **README.md**: Added comprehensive section on multiple-choice functionality
- **API documentation**: Included new data models and processors
- **Examples**: Three new example files demonstrating different usage scenarios

## Summary
This enhancement successfully adds robust multiple-choice question extraction to the `question_maker` library while maintaining the established architecture patterns and providing comprehensive testing and documentation. The functionality is production-ready and handles complex real-world text with high accuracy.
